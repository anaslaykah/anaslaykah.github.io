    description: 
    - Rebuilding Shell in a (TDD)Test Driven Development style project. 
    - I chose Golang to get more familiar with the language and give myself a challenge.
    - "The project supports core Shell functionalities in addition to 2 extensions: navigation of directories and redirection of stdout and stderr."
    technologies: 
    - Git, Go, VS Code, Shell

  - title: Odoo module - Offline Job Queue (at EBTech)
    date: Sep. & Oct. 2023
    description:
      - Built an Odoo module from scratch that relied on the publicly available module Job Queue.
      - The module handled the storing of operations carried out by users during times of non-connectivity to the internet, then executed them when the connection was back on. The execution was done chronologically according to each user's context and permissions using a server-side scheduled action that would fire up periodically.
      - The module handled both single and bulk operations in order to send them to the server through JSON and HTTP controllers as efficiently as possible, while also supporting the ability of sending files in case the operation involved the upload of a certain file.
    technologies: 
      - Odoo(Python), XML, Postman, Docker

  - title: Odoo module - Excel Report Builder (at EBTech)
    date: Aug. & Sep. 2023
    description: 
      - Built an Odoo module from scratch that relied in part on another module that belonged to the company to get the raw data from the DB and on the publicly available module Base report xlsx to build the report, the main idea was to build a module that -with the use of abstraction- would automatically be integrated on any other module once installed; and allow the non-technical user to create .xlsx reports from the browser without having to ask someone to define it by code beforehand (as the documentation in the Base report module shows).
      - "The module offered vast customizability which was demonstrated by:
          - Visually formatting the data presented in the reports.
          - Choosing to show only partial and relevant data instead of having to deal with entire records.
          - Displaying parent-child relations between records in multiple ways depending on the user's desire.
          - The ability to group records by any desired column and display aggregated values for each group."
    technologies: 
      - Odoo(Python), XML, Javascript, Docker
  - title: Auto Translation (Arabic To English)
